# Process Notes

## /onboard

**Technical experience:** Recent CS grad, minimal professional experience. Knows Python best, has touched Java, JS, C++, SQL. Done coursework in web, iOS, and general software dev. Describes himself as rusty. AI experience is primarily Cursor in "build it for me" mode — limited independent debugging ability.

**Learning goals:** Understand LLM capabilities and limits; develop best practices for AI-assisted dev; keep own skills sharp while leveraging AI. Well-articulated goals — not just here to ship, here to grow.

**Creative sensibility:** Heavy technical/productivity reading list (Chip Huyen, Neal Ford, Cal Newport, Kleppmann). Struggling with consistency and prioritization. Strong *Deep Work* connection to his app idea — worth surfacing in scope.

**Prior SDD experience:** None. Complete baseline. First exposure to structured planning before building.

**Energy and engagement:** Came in with a clear, concrete app idea already formed. Thoughtful and self-aware about his gaps. Motivated by growth, not just output. Should respond well to being pushed toward deeper thinking.

## /scope

**How the idea evolved:** Sam arrived with a well-formed concept (schedule-based blocking with friction mechanics) and it sharpened considerably through conversation. The accountability partner feature was initially central but got correctly demoted to post-MVP once the scope was interrogated. The "time regained" framing emerged from Sam's description of the home screen and became a core product philosophy.

**Pushback received:** Challenged on what the absolute MVP core was — Sam correctly identified schedule-based blocking + friction mechanics, cutting the accountability partner and timer/tracker. Also probed on where friction becomes annoying; Sam's response (user-configurable friction levels) was a smart, principled answer rather than a cop-out.

**References that resonated:** OneSec (friction mechanics, physical actions) and Opal (strict commitment, streaks) both landed well. Sam took specific things from each rather than wholesale adopting either approach. The Deep Work connection (Cal Newport) was already present in Sam's thinking — the "time regained" framing is a natural expression of Newport's philosophy.

**Deepening rounds:** Two rounds. Round 1 surfaced the app's vibe (calm, organized, modern), the friction tier system (Minimal/Moderate/Extreme with random selection within tier), the scheduling UX (weekday default + custom), and the home screen layout. Round 2 fleshed out the exact unblock flow, app selection UX (scrollable list + search), and the no-emergency-bypass stance. The extra rounds materially improved the scope doc — the friction tier structure and "time regained" framing both came from round 1+2.

**Active shaping:** Sam drove several key decisions independently: the three friction tiers with random selection (not prompted), the "time regained" language (unprompted), the no-emergency-bypass stance (firm). Accepted the suggestion to cut the accountability partner from MVP without pushback, which was the right call. Genuinely engaged, not passively accepting suggestions.

## /prd

**What the learner added vs the scope doc:** The scope doc sketched 5 high-level bullet points. The PRD conversation expanded each into detailed behavior: the wizard is two sequential screens (app selection → schedule), friction activities have exact UI flows (cat picture + two button options, physical actions with random counts, math problems with retry), the home screen has a precise layout (countdown above lock, secondary unlock countdown below), and the unlock mechanic split into two distinct modes (home screen = all apps, app tap = single app) with defined expiry behavior.

**"What if" questions that surprised Sam:** The mid-wizard exit scenario (what happens if you close the app partway through setup) hadn't been considered — Sam landed on resume-where-you-left-off after being pushed to think about user experience rather than implementation convenience. The pre-session countdown question (what does the timer show at 8:50am before a 9am session?) also hadn't been thought through; Sam's answer (0) was immediate and consistent. The "editing during a session" scenario prompted a principled call: block all changes mid-session, consistent with the app's no-escape philosophy.

**What Sam pushed back on or felt strongly about:** The manual lock/unlock button — Sam initially described it as a toggle, then revised it mid-conversation to be unlock-only, with locked/unlocked state driven purely by the schedule. This was a significant design clarification he initiated himself. The no-emergency-bypass stance remained firm (carried over from scope). The "whichever is easier to implement" response on wizard resume behavior was the one moment he tried to defer to tech — redirected back to UX, he landed immediately on the right answer.

**Scope guard:** No new scope creep emerged during the PRD conversation. The session-editing block and live app list changes were refinements, not additions. All post-MVP items (accountability partner, streaks, per-app stats) stayed deferred without revisiting.

**Deepening rounds:** One round. Surfaced: pre-session countdown shows 0 (consistent with non-scheduled days), custom schedule supports per-day on/off toggling, friction doesn't transfer between unlock modes (app-specific unlock doesn't cover other apps), friction activity resets on app background/switch, app list changes take effect immediately. The round meaningfully sharpened the unlock mechanics and schedule edge cases.

**Active shaping:** Sam was consistently active. Key moments: revised the lock button design mid-conversation (his own initiative), specified the exact two-popup structure for Minimal tier (cat picture → "are you sure") including the detail that the second popup is universal across all tiers, and made the "immediately" call on app list changes without hesitation. The friction tier descriptions were unprompted and specific. Passive moments were rare — the wizard resume behavior was the clearest one.

## /spec

**Stack decisions:**
- Swift + SwiftUI + Family Controls (FamilyControls, ManagedSettings, DeviceActivity) + CoreMotion + SwiftData + UserNotifications
- FamilyActivityPicker adopted over custom app list (saves entitlement complexity, trades design control)
- Family Controls (Path B, true OS-level blocking) chosen over Shortcuts Automation despite entitlement delay — Sam correctly identified that the app's core commitment requires genuine blocking, not friction-only
- Hackathon plan: local device demo with screenshots; apply for distribution entitlement post-hackathon

**Architecture decisions:**
- Three-target Xcode project: main app + DeviceActivityMonitor extension + ShieldConfiguration extension
- SharedStore (App Group UserDefaults) for cross-target communication; SwiftData for main app only
- "Time saved" reframed from historical-baseline comparison to blocked-time-minus-unlock-time; Sam accepted quickly — the reframe was clean and technically unblocked an API limitation
- Unlock state: allAppsUnlockExpiry supersedes individual unlocks; Instagram re-locks when all-apps expiry fires (Sam's call, clean and consistent)
- Authorization gate: blocks all access (onboarding + home) if Family Controls denied; re-prompts immediately

**What Sam was confident about:** The Path B choice, the re-lock behavior (Instagram re-locks with everything), the authorization gate UX. These were immediate, clear answers.

**What Sam was uncertain about / needed explaining:** The multi-target extension architecture required re-explanation before the SharedStore question landed. He asked for clarification on what each extension does — answered with a table, then the question connected. Not a gap in his thinking, just unfamiliar territory.

**Deepening rounds:** One round. Surfaced: full SharedStore contents (blockedApps, isSessionActive, sessionEndTime, frictionTier, allAppsUnlockExpiry, individualUnlockExpiries, onboarding state, auth status), both unlock expiry modes and their interaction, and the Family Controls authorization failure strategy. The round meaningfully tightened the data architecture — without it, SharedStore would have been underspecified and /build would have had to make these decisions on the fly.

**Active shaping:** Sam drove the Path B decision independently and pushed back implicitly on Path A (Shortcuts) by identifying the loophole in the entitlement requirement (dev builds on personal device). The time-saved reframe was accepted without friction. The unlock interaction edge case (all-apps expiry + individual unlock) was a prompted question and Sam answered immediately and correctly.

## /build

### Step 1: Xcode project scaffold — three targets, SharedStore, SwiftData models, tab bar

**What was built:**
- Three-target Xcode project generated via xcodegen (xcodegen 2.45.3, Xcode 26.2, iOS 26 SDK)
- Three targets: FocusLock (main app), DeviceActivityMonitor extension, ShieldConfiguration extension
- App Group `group.focuslock` configured in all three targets via entitlements
- Family Controls entitlement added to all three targets
- `SharedStore.swift` (Shared/) wraps `UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.focuslock")` — all nine keys from spec defined
- SwiftData models: `Schedule`, `DaySchedule`, `SessionLog` in `FocusLock/Models/FocusData.swift`
- `ContentView.swift` with routing logic (auth gate placeholder → onboarding placeholder → MainTabView)
- `MainTabView` with three tabs: Home, Schedule, Stats (each a placeholder view)
- `focuslock://` URL scheme registered in Info.plist; stub handler in `FocusLockApp.swift`
- Stub implementations of `MonitorExtension` and `ShieldConfigExtension` compile cleanly
- Build SUCCEEDED with no errors on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

**Issues encountered:**
- xcodegen cleared entitlement files when `properties` wasn't specified inline — fixed by moving entitlement values into project.yml
- Swift 6 concurrency: `SharedStore.shared` static property flagged as non-`Sendable` — fixed with `nonisolated(unsafe)` and `@unchecked Sendable`
- `ShieldConfiguration.Label` initializer changed in newer SDK to require `text:` label — fixed

**Learner verification observation:** Saw onboarding placeholder on first launch (correct — routing logic was live). Tapped "Skip to Tab Bar (Dev)" button, confirmed three-tab MainTabView appeared (Home, Schedule, Stats).

**Comprehension check answer:** "All three targets need it" — correct. Understood that SharedStore.swift must be compiled into each target's binary separately because extensions can't import from the main app module.

### Step 2: Authorization gate — FamilyControls auth request and denial handling

**What was built:**
- `AuthorizationGateView.swift` — full-screen gate with orange lock shield icon, "Screen Time Access Required" title, and "Grant Access" button that calls `AuthorizationCenter.shared.requestAuthorization(for: .individual)` and writes result to SharedStore
- `FocusLockApp.swift` updated — `.task` modifier calls `requestAuthorization()` on launch; `#if DEBUG` stub with `useAuthStub` / `stubStatus` flags bypasses real API for visual testing; stub also resets `hasCompletedOnboarding = false` for clean flow testing
- `ContentView.swift` updated — replaced `AuthorizationGatePlaceholder` with real `AuthorizationGateView`; routing switched from `if/else` to `switch` on authStatus with explicit handling of "notDetermined" (blank screen during auth check), "denied" (gate), "authorized" (onboarding or tabs)

**Issues encountered:**
- `FamilyControlsMember.individualWebDomains` does not exist in this SDK — fixed to `.individual`
- On first verification run, app jumped straight to tab bar because `hasCompletedOnboarding = true` was persisted from Step 1's "Skip to Tab Bar (Dev)" button — fixed by adding `hasCompletedOnboarding = false` reset to the debug stub

**Learner verification observation:** Confirmed gate appeared with `stubStatus = "denied"`. After fix, confirmed onboarding placeholder appeared with `stubStatus = "authorized"`.

**Comprehension check answer:** "@AppStorage re-renders automatically" — correct. Understood that the routing lives in ContentView because `@AppStorage` subscribes to UserDefaults changes and triggers re-renders automatically, eliminating manual state plumbing.

### Step 3: Onboarding — app selection (FamilyActivityPicker + friction tier selector)

**What was built:**
- `AppSelectionView.swift` — "Choose Apps" button triggers `.familyActivityPicker()` sheet; segmented control for friction tier (Minimal pre-selected); Continue button disabled until selection is non-empty; `#if DEBUG` bypass button for simulator testing (no Family Controls in sim); `saveAndContinue()` encodes `FamilyActivitySelection` via `PropertyListEncoder`, writes `blockedApps`, `frictionTier`, and `onboardingStep = 1` to SharedStore
- `ScheduleSetupView.swift` — placeholder for Step 4, with dev skip button
- `ContentView.swift` updated — added `@AppStorage("onboardingStep")` routing; `OnboardingPlaceholder` removed; now routes to `AppSelectionView` (step 0) or `ScheduleSetupView` (step 1)
- `FocusLockApp.swift` debug reset updated to also reset `onboardingStep = 0`
- `xcodegen generate` required after file creation — noted for future steps

**Issues encountered:**
- New Swift files created on disk weren't included in the Xcode project until `xcodegen generate` was re-run. Will need to do this after every new file creation.

**Learner verification observation:** Saw AppSelectionView on launch (past auth gate). Tapped Continue (via debug bypass), navigated to ScheduleSetupView placeholder. Flow confirmed correct.

**Comprehension check answer:** "NavigationStack push" — incorrect. Correct answer: `@AppStorage` write in `ContentView` triggers re-render which swaps the view. Brief explanation given pointing to `ContentView.swift` line 25.

### Step 4: Onboarding — schedule setup, custom schedule, and wizard resume

**What was built:**
- `ScheduleSetupView.swift` — Form with "Every weekday" toggle, start/end `DatePicker` (9 AM / 5 PM defaults), "Include weekends" toggle, "Custom schedule" NavigationLink, and Finish button; `onChange` syncs default time pickers to all enabled days; `saveAndFinish()` deletes existing `Schedule` records, inserts new `Schedule` + `DaySchedule` objects via SwiftData `modelContext`, writes `hasCompletedOnboarding = true` to SharedStore
- `CustomScheduleView.swift` — Form with 7 day sections; each has a Toggle and conditionally-visible start/end DatePickers when enabled; receives `$days` binding from ScheduleSetupView; Done button dismisses
- `DayConfig` struct (file-level in ScheduleSetupView.swift) — in-memory representation shared between both views
- Wizard resume already handled by ContentView routing (`onboardingStep == 1` → ScheduleSetupView); confirmed working via force-quit + relaunch test
- `xcodegen generate` re-run after new file creation

**Issues encountered:** None.

**Learner verification observation:** Saw all expected UI elements. Confirmed Custom view shows per-day toggles and time pickers. Confirmed Finish navigates to home screen. Force-quit + relaunch resumed at schedule setup (not app selection).

**Comprehension check answer:** "6:00 PM" — correct. Understood that `@Binding` passes a reference to the parent's state, so edits in CustomScheduleView write through to ScheduleSetupView's `days` array directly.

### Step 5: Home screen — lock icon, session countdown, time saved today, unlock button

**What was built:**
- `HomeView.swift` — full implementation replacing the Step 5 placeholder
- Top-to-bottom layout: session countdown (monospaced, `Timer.publish` every 1s, shows "0:00" when no session), lock icon (SF Symbol `lock.fill` red / `lock.open.fill` secondary), time saved today (`@Query` on `SessionLog` filtered to today, `sessionDuration - totalUnlockMinutes` summed), Unlock button (`.disabled(!isSessionActive)`), secondary countdown (orange, visible only when `allAppsUnlockExpiry` is non-nil and in the future)
- `Date?` values (`sessionEndTime`, `allAppsUnlockExpiry`) polled from `SharedStore.shared` on each timer tick — `@AppStorage` doesn't support `Optional<Date>` natively
- Unlock button is a stub — `FrictionRouter` wired in step 6
- `ScheduleView.swift` updated with `@AppStorage("isSessionActive")` session editing gate; orange lock label displayed when session is active (edit controls added in step 10)

**Issues encountered:** None. Build SUCCEEDED on first attempt with one existing warning (nonisolated(unsafe) on SharedStore.shared — pre-existing, not introduced in this step).

**Learner verification observation:** Confirmed open lock + 0:00 + grayed Unlock on home screen. Manually set `isSessionActive = true` and `sessionEndTime` in code — confirmed lock closed (red), countdown ticked, Unlock enabled. Set `allAppsUnlockExpiry` — confirmed secondary orange countdown appeared. Navigated to Schedule tab with session active — confirmed orange gate label appeared.

**Comprehension check answer:** "@AppStorage only works in the main app target" — incorrect. Correct answer: `@AppStorage` doesn't natively support `Optional<Date>` (type gap, not target gap). Brief explanation given: `@AppStorage` accepts `String`, `Bool`, `Int`, `Double`, `Data` — not `Date?`, so the timer poll is the workaround.

### Step 6: Friction activities — FrictionRouter, MinimalView, ModerateView, ExtremeView, ConfirmationView

**What was built:**
- `AppRouter.swift` — `@Observable` class with `pendingUnlockSource: UnlockSource?`; set by Unlock button or URL handler, observed by ContentView to present FrictionRouter as fullScreenCover
- `FrictionRouter.swift` — defines `UnlockSource` (Identifiable enum), `ModerateActivity` enum, and `FrictionRouter` view; picks activity at `init()` time via `State(initialValue:)`; routes to MinimalView / ModerateView / ExtremeView; on completion, swaps to ConfirmationView via `@State var activityCompleted`
- `MinimalView.swift` — cat image (SF Symbol fallback until real images added to Assets.xcassets/CatImages/) + random guilt-trip string; "OK" dismisses, "No" → ConfirmationView
- `MotionService.swift` — `@Observable` CMMotionManager wrapper; rotation via Z-axis cumulative tracking (±2π per rotation), shake via acceleration magnitude > 2.5g with 0.5s debounce; observable `rotationCount` / `shakeCount` auto-update ModerateView progress display
- `ModerateView.swift` — wait (10s timer + ProgressView), rotate (MotionService rotation detection), shake (MotionService shake detection); simulator debug button for rotate/shake; resets on `sceneDidBecomeActive` via NotificationCenter
- `ExtremeView.swift` — generates `(a × b) + c` problem at init; text field + Submit; incorrect answer shows "Incorrect" banner for 2s and resets input
- `ConfirmationView.swift` — reads `sessionEndTime` from SharedStore for time-remaining string; "Stay Focused" → dismiss; "Yes" → prints (BlockingService wired in Step 7)
- `HomeView.swift` updated — `isAppsUnlocked` computed property (allAppsUnlockExpiry > now); lock icon shows green open lock when unlocked; Unlock button disabled when `!isSessionActive || isAppsUnlocked`
- `FocusLockApp.swift` updated — `@State private var router = AppRouter()`; `.environment(router)` on ContentView; `handleURL` now routes `source=home` → `.homeScreen` and `source=shield&app=<id>` → `.shield(bundleID:)`
- `ContentView.swift` updated — `@Environment(AppRouter.self)`, `@Bindable var router = router`; `.fullScreenCover(item: $router.pendingUnlockSource)` presents FrictionRouter

**Issues encountered:**
- Bug caught during verification: HomeView lock icon stayed red and Unlock button remained enabled when `allAppsUnlockExpiry` was active. Fixed by adding `isAppsUnlocked` computed property and using it in both the icon color logic and the button's `.disabled()` modifier.

**Learner verification observation:** Confirmed green open lock and disabled Unlock button when unlock window active. Confirmed "Yes" console print in Xcode debugger.

**Comprehension check answer:** "Body rerenders would repick a new activity" — correct. Understood that the view body runs on every state change, so `@State(initialValue:)` in `init()` is the right place to lock in the random selection for the session.

### Step 7: BlockingService + NotificationService — unlock logic and re-lock scheduling

**What was built:**
- `BlockingService.swift` — `unlockApp(source:)` handles both `.homeScreen` (clear all ManagedSettings shielding, write `allAppsUnlockExpiry = now + 15min`, supersede individual expiries) and `.shield(bundleID)` (clear all shielding as fallback, write `individualUnlockExpiries[bundleID] = now + 15min`); `relockAll()` restores full shielding from `SharedStore.blockedApps`; `relock(bundleID:)` calls `relockAll()` as a safe fallback pending token availability in Step 9
- `NotificationService.swift` — `scheduleUnlockWarning(expiry:identifier:)` fires at `expiry - 3min`; `cancelWarning(identifier:)` removes pending requests; `requestPermission()` called on launch from `FocusLockApp`
- `ConfirmationView.swift` updated — "Yes" button now calls `BlockingService.shared.unlockApp(source: source)` instead of printing a stub
- `FocusLockApp.swift` updated — `allAppsUnlockExpiry` debug stub line changed from `now + 300s` to `nil` (was causing app to appear pre-unlocked on every launch); notification permission requested on startup
- Note: per-app surgical unshielding (`.shield` case) deferred to Step 9 — ManagedSettings requires `ApplicationToken`, not a bundle ID string; the token flows through `ShieldConfigExtension`

**Issues encountered:**
- Swift 6 concurrency: `BlockingService.shared` and `NotificationService.shared` static properties required `nonisolated(unsafe)` and `@unchecked Sendable` (same pattern as SharedStore in Step 1)
- Debug stub from Step 6 was writing `allAppsUnlockExpiry = now + 300s` on every launch, causing the app to open in an already-unlocked state — removed

**Learner verification observation:** Orange secondary countdown appeared on HomeView after tapping "Yes" in ConfirmationView, confirming `allAppsUnlockExpiry` was written correctly. Print statement confirmed `unlockApp` was being called. Breakpoints did not trigger (debugger quirk with Swift singletons); print-based verification used instead.

---

### Step 8: DeviceActivityMonitor extension — session enforcement and unlock expiry re-lock

**What was built:**
- `MonitorExtension.swift` fully implemented — handles session start (activate ManagedSettings blocking, write isSessionActive/sessionStartTime/sessionEndTime), session end (relockAll, compute duration, write PendingSessionLog, clear session state), all-apps unlock expiry (relockAll, clear allAppsUnlockExpiry), per-app unlock expiry (relock bundleID, remove from individualUnlockExpiries)
- `Shared/PendingSessionLog.swift` — Codable bridge struct for extension → main app session data handoff (extensions can't write SwiftData)
- `SharedStore.swift` extended with sessionStartTime, scheduledEndTimes ([Int: Date] per day), and pendingSessionLog
- `ScheduleSetupView.swift` — saveAndFinish() now registers DeviceActivitySchedule per enabled day (weekday DateComponent restricts to correct day of week), stores scheduledEndTimes in SharedStore
- `BlockingService.swift` — unlockApp() now registers one-shot DeviceActivity intervals for 15-minute unlock expiry re-lock; DeviceActivity call moved to background thread (DispatchQueue.global) to avoid blocking UI
- `HomeView.swift` — consumePendingSessionLog() reads pending log from SharedStore on appear and persists to SwiftData

**Issues encountered:**
- `DeviceActivityCenter` has no `.shared` singleton in this SDK — fixed to `DeviceActivityCenter()`
- `DeviceActivityCenter().startMonitoring()` was blocking the main thread — moved to `DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async` in ConfirmationView and `Task.detached` in BlockingService
- App appeared to freeze during testing — root cause was a debugger breakpoint, not a code issue

**Learner verification observation:** Tapped DEBUG: Start Session, confirmed lock closed and countdown started. Tapped Unlock, completed friction, tapped Yes — secondary orange countdown appeared. Opened a selected blocked app — confirmed it was blocked. ManagedSettings is working with developer signing.

**Comprehension check answer:** "Extensions are separate processes" — correct. Understood that each target compiles to its own binary with its own process and memory space; SharedStore.swift is compiled into each target separately and shares data at runtime via App Group UserDefaults.

---

### Step 9: ShieldConfiguration extension — block screen UI and URL scheme routing

**What was built:**
- `ShieldAction/ShieldActionExt.swift` — new `ShieldActionDelegate` subclass (fourth target). On `.primaryButtonPressed`, encodes the `ApplicationToken` via `JSONEncoder` and writes to `SharedStore.pendingShieldUnlockToken: Data?`, then calls `completionHandler(.close)` to dismiss the shield
- `ShieldAction` target added to `project.yml` with extension point `com.apple.screentime.shield.action`, App Group entitlement, and Family Controls entitlement. Embedded in FocusLock target
- `Shared/SharedStore.swift` updated — added `pendingShieldUnlockToken: Data?` property and key
- `FocusLock/Views/Friction/FrictionRouter.swift` updated — added `UnlockSource.shieldToken(ApplicationToken)` case with ManagedSettings import, enabling surgical per-app unblocking via the actual token rather than a fallback clear-all
- `FocusLock/Services/BlockingService.swift` updated — added `.shieldToken(let token)` case: surgically removes only that token from `store.shield.applications`, tracks expiry via `"shieldToken-\(token.hashValue)"` key in `individualUnlockExpiries`
- `FocusLock/FocusLockApp.swift` updated — added `import ManagedSettings`, `@Environment(\.scenePhase)` observer, and `consumePendingShieldUnlock()` method that decodes the stored `ApplicationToken` and routes to `FrictionRouter` with `.shieldToken(token)` on scene activation
- ShieldConfigExtension visual (from Step 1 stub) already correct — "Stay Focused" / "You're in a focus session" / green "Unlock" button / no changes needed

**Key open issue resolved:** `ShieldActionExtension` does not exist in this iOS 26 SDK — the correct class is `ShieldActionDelegate` in `ManagedSettings` (not `ManagedSettingsUI`). Also resolved: `ShieldActionDelegate` receives `ApplicationToken` (not `Application`), so bundle ID isn't available. Using `ApplicationToken` directly enables surgical per-app unblocking, which is better than the fallback `store.shield.applications = nil` used previously.

**Issues encountered:**
- `ShieldActionExtension` not found at compile — correct class is `ShieldActionDelegate` in `ManagedSettings`
- `JSONEncoder` not in scope in ShieldAction extension target — fixed by adding `import Foundation`

**Verification note:** Full shield flow (tapping blocked app → shield UI → Unlock → friction → confirm) requires Family Controls entitlement and device testing. URL scheme routing verified manually via `focuslock://unlock?source=shield&app=<bundleID>` in Xcode debugger (already wired in Step 7). The pendingShieldUnlockToken handoff can be tested by writing a token to SharedStore directly and putting FocusLock in the foreground.

### Step 10: Schedule & Stats tabs — read-only schedule view and cumulative time saved

**What was built:**
- `ScheduleView.swift` — `@Query` on `Schedule`, sorted days list (1–7), disabled days shown greyed/dimmed at 50% opacity, "Change Time" and "Apps" buttons presenting `ScheduleSetupView` and `AppSelectionView` as sheets, both buttons `.disabled(isSessionActive)`, session gate notice shown when locked
- `StatsView.swift` — `@Query` on all `SessionLog` records, `reduce` over `timeSaved` computed property, formatted as "Xh Ym" (or just "Ym" / "Xh" when one component is zero), `.contentTransition(.numericText())` on the counter
- `ScheduleSetupView.swift` — added `@Environment(\.dismiss)` + `dismiss()` call in `saveAndFinish()`. No-op in onboarding context (ContentView swaps the view via `@AppStorage`); closes the sheet when called from Schedule tab
- `AppSelectionView.swift` — added `init()` to pre-populate `selection` (via `PropertyListDecoder`) and `frictionTier` from SharedStore; added `@Environment(\.dismiss)`; `saveAndContinue()` now calls `dismiss()` when `hasCompletedOnboarding == true` (settings context) instead of advancing `onboardingStep`

**Issues encountered:**
- Change Time and Apps buttons appeared greyed out on first verification. Cause: `isSessionActive` was still `true` in SharedStore from Step 8 debug session testing — never explicitly ended. Fixed by tapping "DEBUG: End Session" on the Home screen.

**Learner verification observation:** Confirmed all 7 days listed with correct times. Disabled days greyed. Change Time and Apps buttons both tappable (after clearing stale session state). Stats tab shows time saved counter (0m on fresh install — correct).

**Comprehension check answer:** "PropertyListEncoder was used to save it" — correct. Understood that the decoder must match the encoder that wrote the bytes; mismatching would cause the decode to return nil and the picker to open empty.

### Step 11: Submit your project to Devpost

**What was built:**
- `.gitignore` created — excluded `build/`, Xcode user data, `.DS_Store`
- Build artifacts removed from git tracking via `git rm --cached`
- All source commits pushed to `github.com/Dam-Sam/sdd_hackathon`
- Devpost submission completed: project name (FocusLock), tagline ("Take back your time"), project story drawn from scope.md and prd.md, built-with tags (Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, FamilyControls, ManagedSettings, DeviceActivity, CoreMotion, iOS 26), screenshots, docs folder artifacts, GitHub repo link

**Learner verification observation:** Submission confirmed live on Devpost.

---

## /checklist

**Sequencing decisions:** Scaffold-first approach: three-target Xcode project + SharedStore + SwiftData models before any feature work. Authorization gate second — gates all subsequent UI. Onboarding before home screen (home screen reads SharedStore values written during onboarding). Friction activities before BlockingService (router needs to exist before unlock calls through). Extensions (DeviceActivityMonitor, ShieldConfiguration) after the blocking layer is wired — they depend on SharedStore and BlockingService being functional. Schedule/Stats tabs last — pure read views that can be built once data is flowing.

**Build mode:** Step-by-step. Sam's learning goals (best practices for AI-assisted dev, keeping own skills sharp) made step-by-step the right fit over autonomous.

**Methodology preferences:** Comprehension checks: yes. Verification: yes, after each item. Git: commit per item. Check-in cadence: learning-driven (most discussion).

**Checklist size:** 11 items. Estimated total build time: 3–4 hours at 15–30 min per item.

**Entitlement discussion:** Sam wants to skip the Family Controls entitlement for now and proceed with stub/mock implementations for the blocking layer during development. Flagged that FamilyControls/ManagedSettings/DeviceActivity are non-functional without it — both on simulator and device. Items 8 and 9 include notes about what can and can't be verified without the entitlement.

**Devpost planning:** Core story: "Productivity app that eliminates distractions on your phone; allowing you to take back your time and spend it on what really matters." Wow-moment screenshots: block screen + friction activities. Deployment: conditional on entitlement approval, otherwise screenshots/screen recording. GitHub repo: to be created as part of submission step (Sam has not yet set one up).

**Active shaping:** Sam proposed the scaffold-first, then app-logic sequence independently — correct instinct, minimal guidance needed on ordering. Accepted the dependency chain explanation (auth → onboarding → home → friction → blocking → extensions → tabs) without pushback. Build mode and preferences chosen quickly and confidently.

**Deepening rounds:** Zero rounds. Sam was ready to generate after the initial checklist walkthrough. The spec was detailed enough that no deepening was needed to achieve specificity.
